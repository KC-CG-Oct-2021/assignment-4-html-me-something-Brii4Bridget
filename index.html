         <h2> How Many Countries on the CONTINENT of AFRICA? </h2>

            <p> Well, the simple and the most accepted answer to this question is that in total there are 54 independent
             sovereign countries in Africa with their Capital states and are recognized by both the African Union as well
             as the United States. Further, Africa is the second largest continent in the world and is a homeland to 54
             i.e. the largest number of countries within a continent in the world. The Atlantic Ocean binds it on the
             west, the red sea and Indian ocean on the east, the Mediterranean Sea on the west and the mingling waters of
             Indian and Atlantic Ocean on the south. Africa accounts for a total land area of about 30,365,000 sq. km
             or 11,724,000 sq. mi. and extends to about 7,400 km from east to west and 8,000 km from north to south.
